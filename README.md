Create a React app for displaying a list of books provided as an external import. This is a continuation of the previous assignment, but should be completed as a separate project:

Create a new project folder
Copy the code from the previous assignment
Create a folder named "data" at the root of your project. Download the attached "books.json" file and place it in this folder.
Somewhere in your code, import the data from "books.json" and use it to render a list of Book components
You can import data from a JSON file like so:
import data from '/path/to/json/data';

The "add" button and the list of books should be displayed in a grid, such that the "add" button sits in its own column while everything remain perfectly align horizontally and vertically.
Modify the Book component so that it displays the book's price instead of the author.
